# Part A: Interactive HTML Basics (60 minutes)

## Module 1: HTML Document Structure (10 minutes)

### Instructor Led (5 minutes)

Create a basic HTML5 document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Key Concepts Explained:**

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` - Declares HTML5 document type
- `<html lang="en">` - Root element with language attribute for accessibility
- `<head>` - Contains metadata (not displayed on page)
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">` - Character encoding for proper text display
- `<meta name="viewport"...>` - Enables responsive design on mobile devices
- `<title>` - Page title shown in browser tab
- `<body>` - Contains all visible content

### Your Practice Exercise (5 minutes)

**Task:** Create your first HTML page

1. Create a new file named `practice.html` in your working folder
2. Write a complete HTML5 document with:

   - Proper DOCTYPE and html structure
   - Title: "HTML Practice - [Your Name]"
   - h1 heading: "Learning HTML Basics"
   - Two paragraphs about why you're learning web development
3. Save and open in your browser to verify it works

```html
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Section Title</h2>
<h3>Subsection Title</h3>
<h4>Sub-subsection Title</h4>

<p>This is a <strong>bold text</strong> and this is <em>italic text</em>.</p>
<p>You can also use <mark>highlighted text</mark> for important information.</p>
<p>This is <small>fine print</small> and this is <del>deleted text</del>.</p>
```

**Key Concepts Explained:**

- Heading hierarchy: h1 → h2 → h3 → h4 → h5 → h6
- Never skip heading levels (don't jump from h1 to h3)
- Only one h1 per page (main page title)
- `<strong>` - Important text (semantic) vs `<b>` (presentational)
- `<em>` - Emphasized text (semantic) vs `<i>` (presentational)
- `<mark>` - Highlighted text
- `<small>` - Fine print, disclaimers
- `<del>` - Deleted/strikethrough text

### Your Practice Exercise (5 minutes)

**Task:** Add content structure to your practice page

Add the following to your `practice.html` (after your existing content):

1. h2 heading: "My Goals"
2. h3 heading: "Short-term Goals"
3. A paragraph listing 3 short-term goals, using `<strong>` for important keywords
4. h3 heading: "Long-term Goals"

     width="600">

<!-- Image with figure and caption -->
<figure>
    <img src="images/sales-chart.png"
         alt="Bar chart showing monthly sales increasing from 10,000 QAR in January to 25,000 QAR in December"
         width="800">
    <figcaption>Figure 1: Annual sales growth for 2025</figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- Multiple images in a figure -->
<figure>
    <img src="images/product1.jpg" alt="Red sports car" width="300">
    <img src="images/product2.jpg" alt="Blue sedan" width="300">
    <figcaption>Our vehicle collection</figcaption>
</figure>
```

**Key Concepts Explained:**

- `src` - Source path to image file (relative or absolute)
- `alt` - Alternative text for accessibility (describe what's in the image)
- Good alt text: "Bar chart showing sales growth" (descriptive)
- Bad alt text: "image" or "chart.png" (not helpful)
- `width` - Image width (use just width, not height, for responsive sizing)
- `<figure>` - Semantic container for images, diagrams, code snippets
- `<figcaption>` - Caption for the figure
- When to use figure: When image needs a caption or is referenced in text

### Your Practice Exercise (5 minutes)

            <td>85.8</td>
        </tr>
    </tfoot>
</table>
```

**Key Concepts Explained:**

- `<table>` - Container for tabular data
- `<caption>` - Table title (important for accessibility)
- `<thead>` - Table header section
- `<tbody>` - Table body (main data)
- `<tfoot>` - Table footer (summaries, totals)
- `<tr>` - Table row

## Tips for Success

### During Part A (Practice Modules)

- Type out all code yourself (don't copy-paste)
- Ask questions if confused
- Experiment with variations
- Save your work frequently
- Keep `practice.html` open as reference

### During Part B (Final Project)

- Reference your `practice.html` for examples
- Build one section at a time
- Test frequently in browser
- Validate HTML as you go
- Use meaningful content (not "lorem ipsum")
- Make it your own (customize colors, names, amounts)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Forgetting closing tags
❌ Skipping heading levels (h1 → h3)
❌ Using generic alt text ("image", "picture")
❌ Missing scope attributes on table headers
❌ Using tables for layout (only for data!)
❌ Not testing links
❌ Forgetting viewport meta tag

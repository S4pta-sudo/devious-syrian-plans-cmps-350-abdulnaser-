ok so some new tags to add to the list

the <meta> tag which allows the browser
to adjust certain details regarding the device 
it also does other things

so the strucutre of an HTML doc:

<html>

</html>



<b> vs <strong>

    they both do the same thing visually

    on a technical side, somethning in a strong
    tag is bound to be more emphasized for those
    technolpgies



semantic tags are tags that are there for decaration
BUT they aid other technical tools whenever they
utilize their webpage, kinda like screen reader
and beyond that these semantic tags have a hand
in SEO and thats why u gotta use em so u would have

* a title wrapped by a header tag

* a list of nav tags for other places

* an article could contain multiple sections
from the same website

* websites are dividedinto these semantic tags for
that very purpose AND YES ARTICLE IS A TAG and so
aer sections which are under the article tag

* ask gpt to get some of the css attriutes of a table
like merging cells and the such



ok so tables cuz i really look forward to how he
explains the table request :P
so table main tag

    similar to page its split to 3 parts, head, body, footer

    the tr tag to make a row and within it we put
    th or td depending on whether we want bold or not
    and that would be columns

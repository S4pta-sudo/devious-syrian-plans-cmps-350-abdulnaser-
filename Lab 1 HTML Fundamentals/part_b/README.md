# Lab 1 Starter Code

This folder contains starter files to help you complete Lab 1: Financial Dashboard Foundation.

## Files Included

### 1. index-template.html
A basic HTML5 template with the document structure and section placeholders.

**How to use:**
- Copy this file to your working directory
- Rename it to `index.html`
- Fill in each section following the lab instructions


**How to use:**
- This is NOT part of your HTML file
- Use this as a reference for realistic financial data
- Copy the values into your HTML tables and sections

## Images Folder

The `images/` folder should contain:
- `myfinance-logo.png` - Dashboard logo (150px wide)
- `emergency-fund.png` - Progress visualization for emergency fund goal
- `car-savings.png` - Progress visualization for car savings goal
- `vacation-savings.png` - Progress visualization for vacation goal

### Using Placeholder Images

If you don't have actual images yet, you can use placeholder services:

```html
<!-- For logo -->
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150x50/4CAF50/FFFFFF?text=MyFinance"
     alt="MyFinance logo"
     width="150">

<!-- For goal progress bars -->
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x60/2196F3/FFFFFF?text=Progress:+83%"
     alt="Progress bar showing 83% completion"
     width="400">
```

### Creating Your Own Images

You can create simple progress bar images using:
- **PowerPoint/Keynote**: Create rectangles with percentage fill
- **Canva**: Free design tool with progress bar templates
- **Google Slides**: Simple shapes and text
- **Paint/Preview**: Basic rectangles and text

**Recommended sizes:**
- Logo: 150px wide
- Progress bars: 400px wide × 60px tall

## Tips

1. **Start with the template**: Don't start from scratch
2. **Reference sample-data.json**: Use realistic financial amounts
3. **Test frequently**: Open your HTML file in a browser after each section
4. **Validate**: Check your HTML at https://validator.w3.org/

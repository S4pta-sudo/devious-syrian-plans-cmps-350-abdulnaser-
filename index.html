<!-- 
 css so far:
 
 * css comes with this thing called a selector which is what is being styled at the moment
 its a while rabbit hole on its own :P

* you could style entire html elements with every instance

*you can style based on certain attributes of HTML elements, classes, IDs, etc

* you could style also based on the state of what you are styling (hover, clicked, etc.)

* now the methods are a whole css file or a <style> </style> tag in an html file

* the syntax for styling anything is:

    * <things name>:<state>{
        css property: css property value;
        css property: css proeprty value;
        .
        .
        .
        }


CSS box model:

        how much space an element takes up (padding)

        how far away is it from other elements (margins)


* achieve specific things in css:

        smooth transitions based on state (from untocuhed to hovering to clicked)

            use the transition property which takes the change itself and how much time it takes

            must have the change be there with respect to the state as well

            u could also stack multiple transitions by spearating by commans and ending the transitions with
            a semi colo

            transition should be in the selector of the item as awhole since it applies during and after the event
    
        shadows in css:

            we would use the box-shadow property, takes 4 property values, the x offset, the y offsent, the blur
            and the color of the shadow

            the color would use the rgba(r, g, b, o) with o being the opacity of the shadow

    
        spacing inside the a button:

            we use the padding selector 
            
            we also use the margin for any spacing outside the button (spacing between different elements)

            we use dev consoles to visualize this for different HTML elements

        aligning buttons:

            this acc depends on the alignment of the text itself, the alignment property
            aligns the buttons wherever they are needed on the website so them alongside the concepts
            of padding, margins, and borders makeup the css box model

            the concept of margins exists within text too
        special symbols in html:

            similar to how in python getting the super and subscripts requires special combinations
            of characters, so too do the these things in HTML, check marks, middle dots etc.
            they are called HTML entites

            this does include the > and < symbols
        
        margins are to be utilized whenever we want a specific number of spaces between text


inheritance in css: (css specificty)

        the highest level would be the html entity itself, so if i style the <p> then all instances
        of the <p> would have these and inherit them, from there classes come    

        tho whoever gets presidence is the class, so the <p> is whats taken initially
        and then if the class is given a value then it overrides the <p>

        tldr priority: the most specific selector takes priority, so generaal selector < class < ID


text elements: (HTML)
    
    think of it as putting an element within the text of another usually, so lets say
    <p>i 
        am the <strong>STORM</strong> that is approaching
    </p>

    now storm here is a text element called strong which just makes the text bold cool?

    so the principle in the simplest of terms is wanting a specific part of text within an element
    to be modified without affecting the whole thing

    the best and most plain tag is the <span> tag

    do keep in mind that these guys are treated like any other  HTML element that we can screw with
    in regards to html


moving on, the structure of an HTML page:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
    <head>

    </head>

    <body>

    </body>
</html>

    * now the doctype just tells the browser what html version to use to render the page and allat

    * the <html> tag houses all the html elements within it, kinda like wrapping paper

    * we are allowed to nest elements if need be

    * the head and body are singletons

    * the body contains everything that the page has to display

    * the head on the other hand manipulates alot of the unseen elements or the undisplayable ones
    if that makes sense like the title and shit




now to avoid the problem of interlanguage communication we can separate the html from the css
using the <link> element:
    
    * the link element is essentially a void element, an element that doesnt need a closing tag

    * these guys do take html attributes but they wont have text outside the tag

    * link takes 2:
        rel = "type", type is essentially what are we linking? a stylesheet? a script? etc. etc

        href = "path to file", the path on my machine where the css file being linked is
    
    * mind u, this ends up just loading the css content into the html that we have implicitely

    *

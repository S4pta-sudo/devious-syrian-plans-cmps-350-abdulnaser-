    Man, this N corp Sinclair ID sucks.
Negative coins? Why did PM add this? It’s literally a ticking bomb that’s about to corrode.
Yeah his skills are powerful but it’s their POTENTIAL power. In practice? He’s never going to be at -45 sanity, so his damage output must be dogshit.
Also how is he going to work with SP healing EGO? Why should I suffer negative consequences for using a freaking EGO?
“Just use his guard” you say, but ain’t that just skipping a turn? What kinda player would think skipping a turn is a good way to balance this stupid ID?
And he can’t even lose his sanity as good as normal IDs gain it! What’s the point?! PM really should hire better people if they think this ID is somehow “good” and “powerful”.
I require Kim himself to apologize for creating such a bad, low damage and high maintenance ID. They should also buff him, maybe 2 separate times, and I demand it TODAY.

    This is an update regarding my friend Sara. As some of you may or may not have known, I have a friend who started playing Limbus and she's infinity better then me at everything. I grew to be spiteful of her secretly praying on her downfall rubbing my hands hoping she fails every clash and every mirror dungeon run she does. Praying every extract is absolutely dog ass. Anyways. Recently she got to Canto 4, and she mentioned getting a new Ishmael ID. This was Sloshing Ismael. Seeing as she was new to the game I see my opportunity and took it. I told her Sloshing Ishmael was The best Ishmael ID and she believed it! She fell for it!! So naive!! How do you like that Sara!? Huh!? And to make it better she was fighting Dongbaek (my wife), and was stuck on her for awhile! (My pookie was helping me) As for me it didn't take me long (she let me win) so not only did I trick her but I was AHEAD OF HER. Things were finally looking up for me!! For once, I had... hope. And then...T-Corp Rodion and Don Came out. Now I love Don Quixote...I love Rodion but Don Quixote is my love. My wife. My pookie. I saw her and I had to get her. I rolled and rolled. But I.... didn't get her. Big Hat Don didn't come home.....But Sara.... Sara got Her first try... there's another person too we'll name him Jacob....they both Got TCorp Don....FUCK YOU JACOB!!!! My life is....Over ...My glory was short lived....I miss Dongbaek....I miss Don..... I'm..... empty now.... there's nothing left for me..... I'm....washed.....Sara noticed how bummed I was about not getting TDon and offered me to use hers as a support. The auDACITY to give me her sloppy seconds....was this truly how low she thought of me? I don't want any handy downs. I would much rather suffer without any TCorp Dons. However due to recent consideration....I realized Sara...perhaps I....treated you too harshly....maybe....we can rekindle our friendship. If you're reading this I'm sorry for the one sided beef but not really. There's.... someone else.... Jacob. If you're reading this, which you most likely are.... You know what you are, and what you did. Your days have been numbered. Count your second, and your minutes. Sleep with one eye open.... I'm always lurking....

    First, immediately ground and add the roots of yellow wither grass within a century of harvest from the mounds; For aetherial lifewood ashes , at the first sight of darkening stir it before incorporation, but it must be first infused with a serpent's scales; as for decayed sulphurs, use the ashes of the tormented dead that has experienced four seasons amply but jabbering daily, but titanium spoon must be used to mix the ingredients. Then, add Whale oil extracted from the Murky Whale; as for the blue-blood of a Lingzhi, it must first be drawn from a child without making a laceration, avoid eye contact, and maintain viscosity level above 80%. Prepare a ex-zyme for only less than 12 days after production. Preserve it in a vessel prior to pulverization, then inject it at a temperature equal to or below 20 celsius.

    I am dropping this game.
PM clearly doesnt know how gacha work. All those early system related blunders made me still believe, but releasing the alt. form of the main girl being obsessed with another guy? Yeah, i have seen where this goes. I wont pay any more money for garbage like this. You better believe me you will get an influx of all the scum of various communities flocking into your fanbase and draw as much cuckold porn of Faust and Sinclair in any version of themselves and Dante watching in the corner.
FGO people unironically tried to warn us that we will get lion'd and it actually happened. Dropped. I am what some would consider a whale (or leviathan depending on your definition) that spend 700 bucks on this game and even if its not much money for me, i actually regret it.
To anyone want to play this game and thought its a safe thing because Dante looks like a self-insert and the voicelines resemble waifu/husband material, dont get baited.
Edit: all i see in the comments are a bunch of white men not having a problem with their girlfriend doing onlyfans. This game is already dead.
Okay, you have to stop, really. Now im getting angry unironically. The amount of people not understanding that this was A TROLL IS INSANE!!! Can you for once stop this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? Okay, fine, maybe it was a little real at first, i mean, i did like Faust but i still didnt mind her loving Sinclair or whatever as Kromer. But everything after that was fake. Can you now please stop? Move on, i do not wish to keep making edits.
Literally, i cant sleep. This was the biggest break i ever had. Its like i went viral. This is the third night i randomly wake up to check messages in here. But it starts to get to me. Im only human. And you know how it is, guys, right? Humans gonna human, haha
Edit: IM SICK OF PRETENDING I WAS JUST PRETENDING THE COMMENTS MAKE MY BLOOD BOIL!!! ♥♥♥♥ any gacha that tries to romance the girls you pay for to other guys. Its like buying a prostitute but for the dude that entered the establishment at the same time as you. Its like paying on a first date with the girl you meet up but her boyfriend is with her. Its like paying for your daughters college just so she can get NAIL'd by a bunch of Sinclairs over there. Jokes aside, PM still had no balls to actually confirm a ship but kept it subtle. In such cases, the subtlety is the same as actually confirming it. Anyone that thinks otherwise is dishonest AS ♥♥♥♥.
There are people that went CRAZY for Grip Faust, saying QUEEEEN YAAAS LITERALLY ME NEET HAHA RODION MAKES HER PIZZA I LOVE HER and people paid OVER SEVENTY BUCKS FOR HER ONLY FOR HER STORY TO BE OBESSED WITH ANOTHER MAN LMAOOOOO
THIS will never be the norm, the vast majority will NEVER tolerate this kind of thing. PMcucks are literally that: cucks that got conditioned over the years by PM through myseryporn. They are so braindead they forgot they are. Illiterates that gush over "muh storie" jacking each other off for looking smart while they never read ANY book based on the characters. Look at the most replied thread here (friendcode thread not counting) and you know what kind of KEKS play this garbage.
